## `IERC1190CreativeLicenseReceiver`



Interface for any contract that wants to support safe transfers
of creative licenses for ERC1190 contracts.


### `onERC1190CreativeLicenseReceived(address operator, address from, uint256 tokenId, bytes data) â†’ bytes4` (external)



Whenever a creative license for {IERC1190} `tokenId` token is transferred to this contract via {IERC1190CreativeOwner-safeTransferCreativeLicense}
by `operator` from `from`, this function is called.

It must return its Solidity selector to confirm the token transfer.
If any other value is returned or the interface is not implemented by the recipient, the transfer will be reverted.

The selector can be obtained in Solidity with `IERC1190CreativeLicenseReceiver.onERC1190CreativeLicenseReceived.selector`.
