### `_safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes data)` (internal)



Same as {_safeMint(address,uint256)}, with an additional `data` parameter which is
forwarded in {IERC1190Receiver-onERC1190OwnershipLicenseReceived} and
{IERC1190Receiver-onERC1190CreativeLicenseReceived} to contract recipients.

- `to` cannot be the zero address.

Emits a {Transfer} event.
