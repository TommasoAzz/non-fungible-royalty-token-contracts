## `IERC1190`



Required interface of an ERC1190 compliant contract.


### `balanceOfOwner(address owner) → uint256 ownerBalance` (external)



Returns the number of owned (though an ownership license) tokens in ``owner``'s account.

### `balanceOfCreativeOwner(address creativeOwner) → uint256 creativeOwnerBalance` (external)



Returns the number of owned (through a creative license) tokens in ``creativeOwner``'s account.

### `balanceOfRenter(address renter) → uint256 renterBalance` (external)



Returns the number of tokens currently rented by ``renter``'s account.

### `ownerOf(uint256 tokenId) → address owner` (external)



Returns the owner of the `tokenId` token.

Requirements:

- `tokenId` must exist.

### `creativeOwnerOf(uint256 tokenId) → address creativeOwner` (external)



Returns the creative owner of the `tokenId` token.

Requirements:

- `tokenId` must exist.

### `approve(address to, uint256 tokenId)` (external)



Gives permission to `to` to transfer `tokenId` token to another account.
The approval is cleared when the token is transferred.

Only a single account can be approved at a time, so approving the zero address clears previous approvals.

Requirements:

- The caller must own the token or be an approved operator.
- `tokenId` must exist.

Emits an {Approval} event.

### `getApproved(uint256 tokenId) → address operator` (external)



Returns the account approved for `tokenId` token.

Requirements:

- `tokenId` must exist.

### `setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved)` (external)



Approve or remove `operator` as an operator for the caller.
Operators can call {transferOwnershipLicense}, {safeTransferOwnershipLicense},
{transferCreativeLicense} or {safeTransferCreativeLicense} for any token
owned by the caller.

Requirements:

- The `operator` cannot be the caller.

Emits an {ApprovalForAll} event.

### `isApprovedForAll(address owner, address operator) → bool` (external)



Returns if the `operator` is allowed to manage all of the assets of `owner`.

See {setApprovalForAll}.

### `safeTransferOwnershipLicense(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)` (external)



Safely transfers `tokenId` token from `from` to `to`, checking first that contract recipients
are aware of the ERC-1190 protocol to prevent tokens from being forever locked.

Requirements:

- `from` cannot be the zero address.
- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- `tokenId` token must exist and be owned by `from`.
- If the caller is not `from`, it must be have been allowed to move this token by either {approve} or {setApprovalForAll}.
- If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement {IERC1190Receiver-onERC1190Received}, which is called upon a safe transfer.

Emits a {Transfer} event.

### `safeTransferOwnershipLicense(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes data)` (external)



Safely transfers `tokenId` token from `from` to `to`.

Requirements:

- `from` cannot be the zero address.
- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- `tokenId` token must exist and be owned by `from`.
- If the caller is not `from`, it must be approved to move this token by either {approve} or {setApprovalForAll}.
- If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement {IERC1190Receiver-onERC1190Received}, which is called upon a safe transfer.

Emits a {Transfer} event.

### `transferOwnershipLicense(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)` (external)



Transfers `tokenId` token from `from` to `to`.

WARNING: Usage of this method is discouraged, use {safeTransferOwnershipLicense} whenever possible.

Requirements:

- `from` cannot be the zero address.
- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- `tokenId` token must be owned by `from`.
- If the caller is not `from`, it must be approved to move this token by either {approve} or {setApprovalForAll}.

Emits a {Transfer} event.

### `safeTransferCreativeLicense(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)` (external)



Safely transfers `tokenId` token from `from` to `to`, checking first that contract recipients
are aware of the ERC1190 protocol to prevent tokens from being forever locked.

Requirements:

- `from` cannot be the zero address.
- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- `tokenId` token must exist and be owned by `from`.
- If the caller is not `from`, it must be have been allowed to move this token by either {approve} or {setApprovalForAll}.
- If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement {IERC1190Receiver-onERC1190Received}, which is called upon a safe transfer.

Emits a {Transfer} event.

### `safeTransferCreativeLicense(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes data)` (external)



Safely transfers `tokenId` token from `from` to `to`.

Requirements:

- `from` cannot be the zero address.
- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- `tokenId` token must exist and be owned by `from`.
- If the caller is not `from`, it must be approved to move this token by either {approve} or {setApprovalForAll}.
- If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement {IERC1190Receiver-onERC1190Received}, which is called upon a safe transfer.

Emits a {Transfer} event.

### `transferCreativeLicense(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)` (external)



Transfers `tokenId` token from `from` to `to`.

WARNING: Usage of this method is discouraged, use {safeTransferCreativeLicense} whenever possible.

Requirements:

- `from` cannot be the zero address.
- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- `tokenId` token must be owned by `from`.
- If the caller is not `from`, it must be approved to move this token by either {approve} or {setApprovalForAll}.

Emits a {Transfer} event.

### `rentAsset(address renter, uint256 tokenId, uint256 rentExpirationDateInMillis)` (external)



Enables the renting of `tokenId` token to `renter`.

Requirements:

- `renter` cannot be the zero address.
- `tokenId` token must exist.

Emits a {AssetRented} event.

### `getRented(uint256 tokenId, address renter) → uint256 rentExpirationDateInMillis` (external)



Returns the expiration date in milliseconds if `renter` is renting `tokenId` token currently.
Calling this function twice could result in two diffent results if the `rentExpirationDateInMillis` corresponds to
an expired date time.

Requirements:

- `tokenId` must exist.
- `renter` must exist.
- `renter` must have rented `tokenId`.


### `Approval(address owner, address approved, uint256 tokenId)`





### `ApprovalForAll(address owner, address operator, bool approved)`





### `TransferOwnershipLicense(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`





### `TransferCreativeLicense(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`





### `AssetRented(address renter, uint256 tokenId, uint256 rentExpirationDateInMillis)`
